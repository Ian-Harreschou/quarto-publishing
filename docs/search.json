    "text": "Common Graphical Techniques\nWe’ll jump right in with some high-level plotting functionalities that control provides, namely in generating Bode plots and root locus diagrams.\n\nFrequency Analysis - Bode Plots\nRecall the utility of Bode plots. They are a graphical tool used to visualize how a given transfer function responds to an oscillatory input, of the form,\n\\[u(t) = A\\sin{\\omega t + \\phi}\\]\nfor a specified amplitude \\(A\\), frequency of oscillation \\(\\omega\\), and phase shift \\(\\phi\\). The Bode plot shows the magnitude (amplitude ratio) of oscillations that will be observed in the output, as well as the response’s phase shift.\nThese plots quickly show us how “well” the dynamics of our system can keep up with\nConsider a transfer function \\[G(s) = \\frac{1}{(\\tau_{1}s + 1)(\\tau_{2}s + 1)}\\]\nwith two poles \\(p_{1}, p_{2}\\) at \\(s = -\\frac{1}{\\tau_{1}}, -\\frac{1}{\\tau_{2}}\\) for \\(\\tau_{1}, \\tau_{2} = 1, \\ 10\\).\n\n\nCode\ns = ctrl.tf('s') # define 's' as a TransferFunction class\n\nt1, t2 = 1, 10\nG1 = 1 / ((t1*s + 1)*(t2*s + 1))\n\nctrl.bode_plot(G1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoot Locus Diagrams\nRoot locus diagrams are graphical tools used to assess the stability of a system as one of its parameters varies – usually the controller gain \\(K_c\\). Here, we’ll look at a few familiar systems from homework. Consider the following open-loop transfer functions, for two systems under PI-control:\n\\[L_{1}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{K_{c}}{1.5}(1.5s+1)}{s(2s+1)(s+1)}\\]\n\\[L_{2}(s) = \\frac{\\frac{K_{c}}{0.5}(0.5s+1)}{s(2s+1)(s+1)}\\]\n\n\nCode\nKc = 1 # placeholder gain to use in tf construction\n\ntau_I = 1.5\n\nGv = 1 # tf of a gate valve (unity loop)\nGm = 1 # tf of a measurement device (unity loop)\n\nGp = 1 / ((2*s+1)*(s + 1)) # tf of the process\nGc = Kc * (1 + 1 / (tau_I*s)) # tf of the controller\n\nGol = Gv*Gm*Gp*Gc\n\nctrl.root_locus_plot(Gol)\n\n\nIgnoring fixed x limits to fulfill fixed data aspect with adjustable data limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nKc = 1 # placeholder gain to use in tf construction\n\ntau_I = 1.5\n\nGc = Kc * (1 + 1 / (tau_I*s)) # tf of the controller\n\nGol = Gv*Gm*Gp*Gc\n\nctrl.root_locus_plot(Gol)\n\n\nIgnoring fixed x limits to fulfill fixed data aspect with adjustable data limits.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhase and Gain Margins\nPhase and gain margins are quantitative measures of relative stability of closed-loop systems, or their ‘robustness’ to model uncertainty and process variation.\\(^{[2]}\\)\nThese quantities essentially tell us how far away from marginal stability the system is, so that we can integrate some semblance of safety into operations.\nQuickly, we will review a few definitions, and then introduce the newer ones.\n(Open) Loop transfer function \\(L(s)\\) – the product of the controller transfer function \\(G_c(s)\\) with an overall process transfer function \\(G(s)\\) (which includes the physical process, any sensors/measurement devices, and control elements such as valves).\n\\[L(s) = G_c(s)G_v(s)G_p(s)G_m(s) = G_c(s)G(s)\\]\nMarginal stability – the point at which we observe sustained (non-decaying) oscillations in our output, when the input to the system is a sinusoidal function. \\[1 + L(s=i \\omega_u) = 0\\]\nOr,\n\\[L(s = i \\omega_u) = -1\\]\nfor an “ultimate” value of \\(K_c = K_{cu}, \\omega = \\omega_{u}\\), above which we become unstable, as the poles will begin moving into the right half of the Re-Im plane.\nPhase crossover (or critical) frequency \\(\\omega_p\\) – the frequency at which the phase of the loop transfer function becomes equal to \\(-180 ^{\\circ}\\).\n\\[ \\omega_p : \\angle {L(i \\omega_p)} = -180 ^{\\circ}\\]\nGain crossover frequency \\(\\omega_g\\) – the frequency at which the magnitude of \\(L(s)\\) becomes equal to one,\n\\[ \\omega_g : |L(i\\omega_g)|=1\\]\nWith these, we can introduce the phase and gain margins.\nPhase margin PM – the phase shift of the loop transfer function at \\(\\omega_g\\) necessary to cause the system to reach marginal stability.\nAnother interpretation is the distance on the phase diagram between the current phase shift and \\(-180^{\\circ}\\).\n\\[PM = \\arg \\big \\{ L(i \\omega_g) \\big \\} - (-180^{\\circ})\\]\nGain margin GM – the factor by which we can scale/multiply the controller gain before the onset of instability\n\\[GM = \\frac{1}{|L(i \\omega_p)|}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nRemember that increasing \\(K_c\\) shifts the amplitude ratio of our transfer function upward on a Bode diagram, while leaving the phase shift unchanged. The opposite is true for a system with time delay; the phase shift will necessarily change, but the magnitude will be left unmodified!\n\n\nA high gain margin corresponds to a system that is far away from instability, but there is a tradeoff, as our controller responds sluggishly.\nA large phase margin is also a sign that the system is far from instability – there is a safety margin for how much time delay the system can handle before seeing sustained (or worse, growing) oscillations in the output.\n\n\nExample1\nAs an illustration of these quantities, take the following PI- controller, aiming to control some 3rd order process:\n\\[G(s) = \\frac{K}{(\\tau_1s + 1)(\\tau_2s + 1)(\\tau_3s+1)}\\]\nfor \\(\\tau_1, \\tau_2, \\tau_3 = 1, 1/2, 1/3\\).\nOur controller has both P- and I-action, which will look like: \\[G_c(s) = K_c (1 + \\frac{1}{\\tau_I s})\\]\nwith a chosen value of \\(\\tau_I = 1/3\\).\nWe are told the product of our process and controller gains are non-zero, e.g. \\(K_c K &gt; 0\\), and from a previous example we want to look at the case where \\(K_c K = 0.5\\)\n\n\nCode\nK = 1 # loop transfer function (process) gain\nKc = 0.5 # controller gain\n\nt1, t2, t3 = 1, 1/2, 1/3\ntI = 1/3\n\nG = K / ((t1*s + 1)*(t2*s + 1)*(t3*s+1))\nGc = Kc * (1 + 1/(tI*s))\n\nL = Gc * G\n\ngm, pm, sm, wpc, wgc, wms = ctrl.stability_margins(L)\n\nctrl.bode_plot(L)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ntable_md = f\"\"\"\n| Parameter | Value |\n|:---------:|:-----:|\n| $\\\\omega_{{pc}}$ | {wpc:.3f} |\n| $\\\\omega_{{gc}}$ | {wgc:.3f} |\n| $GM$            | {gm:.3f}  |\n| $PM$            | {pm:.1f}° |\n\"\"\"\n\ndisplay(Markdown(table_md))\n\n\n\n\n\nParameter\nValue\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\omega_{pc}\\)\n1.414\n\n\n\\(\\omega_{gc}\\)\n0.969\n\n\n\\(GM\\)\n2.000\n\n\n\\(PM\\)\n20.0°\n\n\n\n\n\nDo we expect this open-loop transfer function to be step-stable?

    "section": "Core Functionalities of Python-Control",
    "text": "Core Functionalities of Python-Control\nIn order to do these simulations, the first step is learning how to actually construct transfer functions using the various machinery offered via the package.\n\nConstructing Transfer Functions\nBefore we look at the behavior of transfer functions, we need to know how to construct them.\nIn the control package we can do this a number of ways–such as via state-space representation–but one of the most intuitive or beginner-friendly methods is by defining our symbolic \\(s\\), then using standard algebraic operations to build the polynomials of the transfer function \\(G(s)\\). This is done already in one of the code cells for the Bode / root locus plots, but is shown again in the following cell.\ncontrol includes a “factory function” tf() to construct objects of the TransferFunction class for this purpose.\n\n\nCode\ns = ctrl.tf('s') # define 's' as a TransferFunction class\n\nG = 1 / (2*s + 1)\n\n\nIn this code cell, we are constructing\n\\[G(s) = \\frac{1}{2s + 1}\\]\nby using standard operations with the derivative operator ‘s’.\nIf we wanted to add more information to the transfer function, e.g. a name, or particular tags for inputs/outputs, we can explicitly provide arrays of numbers representing the powers of ‘s’ in the numerator / denominator, then pass additional keywords for namings.\n\n\nCode\nnum = [2.5, 6, 7]\nden = [1, 1.5, 4, 6]\n\nG = ctrl.tf(num, den, name = 'Gc', inputs = ['Ysp'], outputs = ['Y'])\n\n\nThis cell constructs a transfer function\n\\[G(s) = \\frac{2.5s^{2}+6s+7}{s^{3}+1.5s^{2}+4s+6}\\]\nnamed explicitly as Gc, with input Ysp and output Y.\n\n\n\nInput/Output Responses\nOnce we’ve constructed transfer functions from some underlying dynamical system, we’re typically interested in how the system responds to perturbations such as impulses or step changes.\nIf the system is stable, the time-domain response will settle. This could be to its original steady-state, in the case we have an impulse input, a new steady-state if we provide a step-change, or it may never settle if we provide a ramp input.\nAgain, control provides tools for this analysis, with the step_response, impulse_response, and forced_response functions.\n\nImpulse Response\nConsider an impulse signal at \\(t_{0}=0\\) of size 1, such that our input \\(u(t)=\\delta(t)\\):\n\n\nCode\nGp = 1 / ((s + 2)*(s + 1)) # transfer function for a black-box process, with poles at s = -1, -2\n\nresp = ctrl.impulse_response(Gp)\n\nresp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$y(t)$', f'$u(t) = \\\\delta(t)$'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Plotting a delta function doesn’t make a ton of sense by its definition, so \\(u(t)\\) plotted in red here is not accurate. We’d need to make a special graphic or function to plot it true-to-form…\n\n\nStep Response\nHow will the system respond to a constant step input of the form \\(u(t) = M\\), with \\(M = 1\\):\n\n\nCode\nGp = 1 / ((s + 2)*(s + 1)) # transfer function for a black-box process, with poles at s = -1, -2\n\nresp = ctrl.step_response(Gp)\n\nresp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$y(t)$', f'$u(t) = 1$'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice, with this form of transfer function, our system never reaches the value of the step input, giving us a non-zero steady-state offset(generally undesirable) and persistent error.\n\n\nForced Response\nWe can also simulate how the process will respond to an arbitrary input, i.e. a ramp forcing function \\(u(t) = t\\):\n\n\nCode\nGp = 1 / ((s + 2)*(s + 1)) # transfer function for a black-box process, with poles at s = -1, -2\nt = np.linspace(0, 7, num=300)\n\nresp = ctrl.forced_response(Gp, t, t)\n\nresp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$y(t)$', f'$u(t) = t$'])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this case, our process is always trying to keep up with the ramp function, but ultimately won’t close the gap. This also yields a non-zero steady-state offset and persistent error, however we might see the system reach a steady-state difference in signals over a long enough time period. Fun, right?",
