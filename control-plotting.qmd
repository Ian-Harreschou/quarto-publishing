This demonstration takes advantage of the `python-control` package to illustrate tools available for computational / numerical process modeling and control. This package implements basic operations for modeling linear, time-invariant (as well as nonlinear, discrete, and stochastic) control systems. Find the documentation for an installation guide and tutorials [here](https://python-control.readthedocs.io/en/0.10.2/index.html).$^{[1]}$

## Common Graphical Techniques

We'll jump right in with some high-level plotting functionalities that `control` provides, namely in generating Bode plots and root locus diagrams.

### Frequency Analysis - Bode Plots

Recall the utility of Bode plots. They are a graphical tool used to visualize how a given transfer function responds to an oscillatory input, of the form,

$$u(t) = A\sin{\omega t + \phi}$$

for a specified amplitude $A$, frequency of oscillation $\omega$, and phase shift $\phi$. The Bode plot shows the magnitude (amplitude ratio) of oscillations that will be observed in the output, as well as the response's phase shift.

These plots quickly show us how "well" the dynamics of our system can keep up with

Consider a transfer function
$$G(s) = \frac{1}{(\tau_{1}s + 1)(\tau_{2}s + 1)}$$

with two poles $p_{1}, p_{2}$ at $s = -\frac{1}{\tau_{1}}, -\frac{1}{\tau_{2}}$ for $\tau_{1}, \tau_{2} = 1, \ 10$.

```{python}
s = ctrl.tf('s') # define 's' as a TransferFunction class

t1, t2 = 1, 10
G1 = 1 / ((t1*s + 1)*(t2*s + 1))

ctrl.bode_plot(G1)
```

---

### Root Locus Diagrams

Root locus diagrams are graphical tools used to assess the stability of a system as one of its parameters varies -- usually the controller gain $K_c$. Here, we'll look at a few familiar systems from homework. Consider the following open-loop transfer functions, for two systems under PI-control:

$$L_{1}(s) = \frac{\frac{K_{c}}{1.5}(1.5s+1)}{s(2s+1)(s+1)}$$

$$L_{2}(s) = \frac{\frac{K_{c}}{0.5}(0.5s+1)}{s(2s+1)(s+1)}$$

```{python}
Kc = 1 # placeholder gain to use in tf construction

tau_I = 1.5

Gv = 1 # tf of a gate valve (unity loop)
Gm = 1 # tf of a measurement device (unity loop)

Gp = 1 / ((2*s+1)*(s + 1)) # tf of the process
Gc = Kc * (1 + 1 / (tau_I*s)) # tf of the controller

Gol = Gv*Gm*Gp*Gc

ctrl.root_locus_plot(Gol)
```

```{python}

Kc = 1 # placeholder gain to use in tf construction

tau_I = 1.5

Gc = Kc * (1 + 1 / (tau_I*s)) # tf of the controller

Gol = Gv*Gm*Gp*Gc

ctrl.root_locus_plot(Gol)
```

### Phase and Gain Margins

Phase and gain margins are quantitative measures of relative stability of closed-loop systems, or their 'robustness' to model uncertainty and process variation.$^{[2]}$ 

These quantities essentially tell us how far away from *marginal stability* the system is, so that we can integrate some semblance of safety into operations.

Quickly, we will review a few definitions, and then introduce the newer ones.

**(Open) Loop transfer function $L(s)$** -- the product of the controller transfer function $G_c(s)$ with an overall process transfer function $G(s)$ (which includes the physical process, any sensors/measurement devices, and control elements such as valves).

$$L(s) = G_c(s)G_v(s)G_p(s)G_m(s) = G_c(s)G(s)$$

**Marginal stability** -- the point at which we observe sustained (non-decaying) oscillations in our output, when the input to the system is a sinusoidal function.
$$1 + L(s=i \omega_u) = 0$$ 

Or,

$$L(s = i \omega_u) = -1$$ 

for an "ultimate" value of $K_c = K_{cu}, \omega = \omega_{u}$, above which we become unstable, as the poles will begin moving into the right half of the *Re-Im* plane.

**Phase crossover (or *critical*) frequency $\omega_p$** -- the frequency at which the phase of the loop transfer function becomes equal to $-180 ^{\circ}$. 

$$ \omega_p : \angle {L(i \omega_p)} = -180 ^{\circ}$$

**Gain crossover frequency $\omega_g$** -- the frequency at which the magnitude of $L(s)$ becomes equal to one, 

$$ \omega_g : |L(i\omega_g)|=1$$

With these, we can introduce the phase and gain margins. 

**Phase margin** *PM* -- the phase shift of the loop transfer function at $\omega_g$ necessary to cause the system to reach *marginal stability*. 

Another interpretation is the *distance* on the phase diagram between the current phase shift and $-180^{\circ}$.

$$PM = \arg \big \{ L(i \omega_g) \big \} - (-180^{\circ})$$

**Gain margin** *GM* -- the factor by which we can scale/multiply the controller gain before the onset of instability

$$GM = \frac{1}{|L(i \omega_p)|}$$

:::{.callout-note}
Remember that increasing $K_c$ shifts the amplitude ratio of our transfer function upward on a Bode diagram, while leaving the phase shift unchanged. The opposite is true for a system with time delay; the phase shift will necessarily change, but the magnitude will be left unmodified!
:::

A [high gain margin]{.mark} corresponds to a system that is [far away from instability]{.mark}, but there is a tradeoff, as our controller responds sluggishly.

A [large phase margin]{.mark} is also a sign that [the system is far from instability]{.mark} -- there is a safety margin for how much time delay the system can handle before seeing sustained (or worse, growing) oscillations in the output.

#### Example[^1]
As an illustration of these quantities, take the following PI- controller, aiming to control some 3rd order process:

[^1]: See Kravaris & Kookos, Ch. 17.2, Example 17.4, "*PM and GM of a third-order system under PI control*".

$$G(s) = \frac{K}{(\tau_1s + 1)(\tau_2s + 1)(\tau_3s+1)}$$

for $\tau_1, \tau_2, \tau_3 = 1, 1/2, 1/3$. 

Our controller has both P- and I-action, which will look like:
$$G_c(s) = K_c (1 + \frac{1}{\tau_I s})$$

with a chosen value of $\tau_I = 1/3$.

We are told the product of our process and controller gains are non-zero, e.g. $K_c K > 0$, and from a previous example we want to look at the case where $K_c K = 0.5$

```{python}

K = 1 # loop transfer function (process) gain
Kc = 0.5 # controller gain

t1, t2, t3 = 1, 1/2, 1/3
tI = 1/3

G = K / ((t1*s + 1)*(t2*s + 1)*(t3*s+1))
Gc = Kc * (1 + 1/(tI*s))

L = Gc * G

gm, pm, sm, wpc, wgc, wms = ctrl.stability_margins(L)

ctrl.bode_plot(L)
```

```{python}
table_md = f"""
| Parameter | Value |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| $\\omega_{{pc}}$ | {wpc:.3f} |
| $\\omega_{{gc}}$ | {wgc:.3f} |
| $GM$            | {gm:.3f}  |
| $PM$            | {pm:.1f}° |
"""

display(Markdown(table_md))
```

Do we expect this open-loop transfer function to be step-stable? What might the "output" look like when we simulate a step input? 

How about for the fully-connected, closed-loop response?

:::{.callout-important}
Recall the poles of our $L(s)$ are purely real, and lie in the left-hand portion of the *Re-Im* plane.

$$ L(s) = (1 + \frac{1}{\tau_I s}) \frac{k_c k}{(\tau_1s + 1)(\tau_2s + 1)(\tau_3s+1)} $$

$$ = (\tau_I s + 1) \frac{k_c k}{(\tau_I s)(\tau_1s + 1)(\tau_2s + 1)(\tau_3s+1)} $$
:::

If we have a standard unity feedback loop, the closed-loop response to a change in setpoint will be:

$$G_{CL,sp} = \frac{L(s)}{1 + L(s)}$$

and for a step input, we see the following behavior.

```{python}
t = np.linspace(0,25,num=100)

resp = ctrl.step_response(L / (1 + L), t)

resp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$G_CL(t)$', f'$u(t) = M(t)$'])
```

As we might expect, there's an initial overshoot, oscillatory behavior, and then the system settles to our setpoint with no steady-state error.

Now, let's make use the calculated gain and phase margins to push this system to the brink of instability to confirm the behavior is as we expect!

In this scenario, $(K_c K)_{new} = GM(K_c K)_{old}$


```{python}
t = np.linspace(0,25,num=100)

L = L * gm # scale the original loop transfer function by the previously calculated gain margin

resp = ctrl.step_response(L / (1 + L), t)

resp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$G_CL(t)$', f'$u(t) = M(t)$'])

gm, pm, sm, wpc, wgc, wms = ctrl.stability_margins(L)
```

```{python}
table_md = f"""
| Parameter | Value |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| $\\omega_{{pc}}$ | {wpc:.3f} |
| $\\omega_{{gc}}$ | {wgc:.3f} |
| $GM$            | {gm:.3f}  |
| $PM$            | {pm:.1f}° |
"""

display(Markdown(table_md))
```

Notice in this table, that the phase crossover frequency $w_{pc}$ did not change (indicating the phase shift of the system was unmodified), yet the gain crossover frequency $w_{gc}$ did! Additionally, these two are coincident at $\omega = \sqrt(2)$

Also, we can see that $GM = 1$, $PM = 0^{\circ}$, indicating the gains can't be scaled any further, and the system can't handle any more time delay before becoming unstable.

Finally, just to hit the concepts home, we'll simulate what happens when we increase the gains even further, despite having no wiggle room.

```{python}
t = np.linspace(0,25,num=100)

L = L * (gm+0.05) # scale the loop transfer function by the gain margin plus some small value

resp = ctrl.step_response(L / (1 + L), t)

resp.plot(plot_inputs='overlay', legend_map = ['upper left'], label = [f'$G_CL(t)$', f'$u(t) = M(t)$'])

gm, pm, sm, wpc, wgc, wms = ctrl.stability_margins(L)

ctrl.bode_plot(L)
```

```{python}
table_md = f"""
| Parameter | Value |
|:---------:|:-----:|
| $\\omega_{{pc}}$ | {wpc:.3f} |
| $\\omega_{{gc}}$ | {wgc:.3f} |
| $GM$            | {gm:.3f}  |
| $PM$            | {pm:.1f}° |
"""

display(Markdown(table_md))
```

Since we've pushed the gains of the system and controller too far, now our gain margin is a factor less than 1, and our phase margin is negative.
